Relearning essentials along with implementing testing to catch back up to speed. 

Done: Singly Linked Linked List, Four Basic Sorting Algorithms
TODO: Stacks, queues, trees

**Sorting Algorithims:**

Bubble Sort: Efficiency of O(n^2)

Merge Sort: Efficiency of O(nlog(n))

Insertion Sort: Efficiency of O(n^2)

Quick Sort: Efficiency of O(nlog(n)) average case
